          Comparison

        <h5> 
          Many web developer jobs vary in comparison with regard to what they're looking for in potential applicants as well as experience and education. For example, the first job I looked at was TVF digital based in London. They were asking for an applicant with good knowledge of PHP, MySQL, JavaScript, HTML5 and CS3 whereas the second job I looked at for Venn Group based in Northampton was slightly different. They were asking for knowledge of the above however they did not specify PHP as a requirement. In addition, they asked for previous experience in a business environment as well as the ability to develop web-based user interfaces and reports. Whereas TVF asked for the applicant to have an analytic mind set as well as good collaborative/communication skills. This clearly demonstrates the differences within the industry when applying for different roles.

          Regarding desirable aspects when applying for the role of junior web developer, once again jobs vary. TVF in this case, focus more on CM Systems and additional languages e.g. SilverStripe, JavaScript whereas Venn Group focus more on additional languages e.g. C, C++ with a mix of personal qualities e.g. creativity and enthusiasm.

          Focusing on educational background both jobs ask for similar degrees e.g. minimum 2:1 however TVF ask that it come from a top university whereas Venn Group ask that it be a degree in something IT or Business focussed. In addition, TVF ask for strong technical skills whereas Venn Group ask for 2 years' experience in a business environment.
