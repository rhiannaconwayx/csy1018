        <h5> 
          My experience of learning Web Development in the first term was a tough one. Taking in to account the fact I have never done anything regarding Web Development I believe that even getting this far is quite an achievement. The most frustrating aspect of Web Development for me was the actual coding, I really struggled to have the patience to actually sit down and code, purely because it just took an insane amount of time to do something miniscule. In addition to this, once I had managed to do something I became scared to add more code in case I mucked up the entire thing completely, this led to me creating multiple copies of websites which I now don't think was such a good idea. On the up side though, I really enjoyed making the actual website (when I could get the code to work) as by the end of each finished page I was very proud of what I'd achieved. Essentially coding HTML and CSS is like learning another language and this is a highly valuable skill that I'm proud to say I am studying. 
          Now the final website is finished I'm extremely proud of how much I achieved, and I do really look forward to continuing to build on the skills I have now learnt.
          <p>

          Below you'll find my original wireframes from the start of the project. As you can clearly see the finished product is a lot different to the wireframes but this is likely to happy from a design point of view as certain features don't always work out the way you want them too.

        <h5>In addition to this you can also see my site validation through the W3C validator. It threw a lot of errors at me at first which have since been taken in to account for future development of the website. Often they were trivial things such as empty elements. </h5>
