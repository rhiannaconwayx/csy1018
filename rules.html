        <h5> 
          In my case, I liked the simple layout of Ian's website however, I thought there were not enough interactive features within it. With regard to the MPG and UI for my website, I visited a variety of sources and found that often the ones I liked were very similar in terms of layout. The websites that drew our teams attention the most were that of Ian Lunn, The Zurb Foundation and The Rock Group. These websites were showed to the team who then picked out features that they liked and disliked. After this had been done for each website we each then went away and created our own wireframes based on what we liked and disliked. This then led to everyone having separate ideas for their websites whilst still keeping up with current standards. </h5>

        Zurb Foundation <p>
        <img src="images/zurb.png" alt="Photo of me" style="height: 210px; width: 300px;" />
          <p></p>
        <h5>  The Zurb foundation were a personal favourite of mine (and not just for the amazing name that constantly reminds me of Toy Story's Zerg). I thought the layout was very well presented and the pictures and animations used were very user-friendly. Also the ratio of picture to text was very welcoming. However, I found it was lacking in terms of those little additional features that really make the user go 'WOW!'. There also was a lack of animation within the website and I thought at times it was a little overcrowded with information rather than interactive features. Nonetheless this was a very good website and one of which i would hope to imitate one day.</h5>

        <h5> 
          The Rock Group however had a multitude of interactive features that were very cool. In addition, i really thought their use of animations were amazing and the layout was well thought out as well. Had i had more experience with the likes of Javascript and general coding I would like to think i could product something like this at some point. However, one aspect i did take in to account was the website itself felt extremely laggy when viewed on my Macbook i.e. scrolling down felt very delayed as all the animations tried to catch up. I also think theres a bit too much going on at the same time for this website.
