          <h5> 
            Hello, I'm Rhianna and I'm an aspiring front-end web and mobile developer currently studying at the University of Northampton. I studied IT at A-Level and decided to take on Mobile Computing at University. Upon starting my course, I developed a keen interest in Web Development and I now hope to showcase my talents according to the newest standards in Web Dev. 
          </h5>
          <p></p>
          <h5>Before university I had never studied Web Development before so it's exciting to put the skills I have learnt in to practice and continue to enhance my skills within Web Development.</h5>
